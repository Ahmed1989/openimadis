Unpack the zip file to a folder <yajsw>.
Do not remove or copy files from this folder to any another folder. Do not rename any folders within <yajsw>. 

Java Version
--------------
Call java -version and make sure that your default java installation is 1.5 or higher
If this is not the case make sure that java 1.5 or higher is installed and adapt the environment variable java_exe in bat/setenv.bat  or setenv.sh. NOTE: to display system tray java 1.6 is required. For thread dump with locks java 1.6 is required.


1. 
Start the upload-service you would like to wrap. 
( In case of windows user it is run-upload-daemon.bat, in case of unix users it is run-upload-daemon.sh )

2.
Check the process id of your upload-service. 

Windows: 
go to command prompt and type "jps -lv". 
Search for process id of "java -cp lib\\client-jar.jar;lib\\loci_tools.jar;. com.strandgenomics.imaging.iclient.daemon.UploadDaemonServiceImpl iuploader.properties"

Unix:
go to command prompt and type "ps -aux | grep java". 
Search for process id of "java -cp lib\\client-jar.jar;lib\\loci_tools.jar;. com.strandgenomics.imaging.iclient.daemon.UploadDaemonServiceImpl iuploader.properties"

3. 
Goto yajsw/bat and execute 
genConfig.bat (genConfig.sh for unix users) <pid> (give pid as argument to genConfig)

NOTE: on posix systems (Linux) this command requires root priviliges to access information on other processes
This generates the file yajsw/conf/wrapper.conf which is the configuration file for the upload service

4.
Stop the upload-service (run-upload-daemon.bat/run-upload-daemon.sh from task manager)
Windows:
go to command prompt and type "taskkill /PID <pid>"

Unix:
go to command prompt and type "kill <pid>"

5.
Execute your wrapped upload-service by calling
runConsole.bat(runConsole.sh)

6.
check that your upload-service is running

go to command prompt and type "jps -lv". 
confirm the process is running "java -cp lib\\client-jar.jar;lib\\loci_tools.jar;. com.strandgenomics.imaging.iclient.daemon.UploadDaemonServiceImpl iuploader.properties" 

Unix:
go to command prompt and type "ps -aux | grep java". 
confirm the process is running "java -cp lib\\client-jar.jar;lib\\loci_tools.jar;. com.strandgenomics.imaging.iclient.daemon.UploadDaemonServiceImpl iuploader.properties"


7.
To Install the upload-service as service, call

installService.bat(installService.sh)

8.
To start the service:

startService.bat(startService.sh)

After this the Upload-Deamon for Acquisition client is running. You can use upload/upload in background menu from acquisition client to start uploading in background.
